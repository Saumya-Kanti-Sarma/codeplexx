## How It Started?

> "I love reading tech articles and tutorials, but most are either too complex or just copies of documentation, making them hard for beginners. As a developer, I wanted to create a platform that makes tech content accessible and engaging. Inspired by Bill Gates' CodePlex and the UI/UX of TechCrunch, I dedicated over two months to building Codeplexx from scratch—writing every line of code myself, with a little help from Copilot for error fixing and demo data."
